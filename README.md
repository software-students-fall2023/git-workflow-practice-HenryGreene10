1. Here is a link to an interesting article about habits of great software engineers: [7 simple habits of the top 1% of engineers](https://engineercodex.substack.com/p/7-simple-habits-of-the-top-1-of-engineers?utm_source=tldrnewsletter).

2. This article speaks about how software engineers should focus more on being an engineer and not a coder. This was interesting because it mentions how sometimes a slower approach to projects, with more initial planning, can often lead to a quicker release of good code. Compared to rushing into projects and refusing to approach the problem from multiple angles. From this article I learned that many good programmers often start over projects with no attachment. Simple code is often the most effective. The article also talks about communication when developing software, which I feel is applicabel to this class, being that we will be working in groups on projects.

## Comments

I completely agree with your takeaways from the article you provided especially with the distinction between being a competent engineer and just a regular old coder. Engineering always emphasizes solutions not just some quick code writing. The insight about the benefits of a slower coding approach for so much quicker quality releases was something I could relate to. Rushed projects often result in lots of technical requirements, and upfront investment in clean and simple code can prevent this in the long run.
