1. Here is a link to an interesting article about habits of great software engineers: [7 simple habits of the top 1% of engineers](https://engineercodex.substack.com/p/7-simple-habits-of-the-top-1-of-engineers?utm_source=tldrnewsletter).

2. This article speaks about how software engineers should focus more on being an engineer and not a coder. This was interesting because it mentions how sometimes a slower approach to projects, with more initial planning, can often lead to a quicker release of good code. Compared to rushing into projects and refusing to approach the problem from multiple angles. From this article I learned that many good programmers often start over projects with no attachment. Simple code is often the most effective. The article also talks about communication when developing software, which I feel is applicabel to this class, being that we will be working in groups on projects.
